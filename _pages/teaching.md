## Teaching Philosophy

简短写一段你的教学理念，比如：  
I view teaching as a process of helping learners connect language, technology, and real-life communication. I aim to design learning experiences that are student-centered, authentic, and grounded in evidence-based instructional design.

（这段你之后可以随时换成你自己的版本。）
