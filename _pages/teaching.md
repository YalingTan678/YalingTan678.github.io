<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<p>My teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that language acquisition is most effective when it is data-informed, authentic, and technologically empowered. Drawing on my research in Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) and AI-assisted self-directed learning, I aim to transition students from passive recipients of knowledge to active, autonomous learners who can navigate real-world linguistic challenges.</p>
