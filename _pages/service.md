My service philosophy centers on inclusive design, mentorship, and community-building. I believe that academic leadership is not only about organizing and supporting—it’s about amplifying voices, fostering meaningful connections, and designing systems that empower others. Through my roles in student organizations and mentorship programs, I aim to create spaces where ideas are shared, identities are respected, and learning is collaborative.
