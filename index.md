I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Learning Design & Technology at Purdue University, advised by Dr. Victoria Lynn Lowell (walker). I received my master's degree in Interpreting, Northeastern University in China in 2024. My research sits at informal digital learning of English, self-directed learning, and AI-mediated learning. I explore how generative AI can support equitable, authentic, and pragmatically rich learning experiences for multilingual learners.
