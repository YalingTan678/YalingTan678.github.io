# Lily Tan

I am a Ph.D. student in Learning Design & Technology at Purdue University. My work sits at the intersection of language learning, educational technology, and AI-mediated learning environments. I am especially interested in how generative AI can support equitable, authentic, and pragmatically rich learning experiences for multilingual learners.

## Research Interests

    <div style="background:#fafafa; border-radius:18px; padding:1.25rem 1.5rem; box-shadow:0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.08); height:100%;">
      <h3 style="margin-top:0;">AI-mediated Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) & Pragmatics</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0.6rem;">
        I design and study AI-mediated extramural learning experiences that aim to enhance learners’ pragmatic and communicative
        competence. My current projects explore how generative AI chatbots, podcasts, and self-directed tasks can scaffold L2
        learners’ pragmatic awareness, agency, and digital literacy in Chinese EFL contexts.

  <!-- 研究兴趣 2：Technology, Equity & ID -->
  <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    <div style="background:#fafafa; border-radius:18px; padding:1.25rem 1.5rem; box-shadow:0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.08); height:100%;">
      <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Technology, Equity, and Instructional Design</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0.6rem;">
        I also examine how digital technologies shape learning opportunities for students from different socioeconomic and
        institutional backgrounds. This includes a large-scale meta-analysis of technology-based interventions and design work
        on AI-supported academic writing, academic integrity, and AI literacy in higher education.
