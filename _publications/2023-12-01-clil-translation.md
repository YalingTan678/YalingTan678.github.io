## Abstract

The development of Master of Translation and Interpreting (MTI) has witnessed a vigorous growth in recent years. Whereas there are still some outstanding problems in discipline orientation, cur-riculum setting, teaching methods and practice base construction, which are important aspects of talent cultivation. Through reviewing the problems and suggested reform methods in the cultiva-tion of MTI majors, this study points out that the most fundamental problem of MTI is the insuffi-cient understanding about the nature and orientation of the discipline. Enlightened by Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), this study proposes that the training and cultivation of MTI majors should carry out more indepth innovations in the aspects of curriculum reform, field training enhancement, teaching methods innovation, and rational establishment and utilization of training bases.
