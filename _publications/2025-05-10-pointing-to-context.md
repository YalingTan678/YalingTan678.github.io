## Abstract

With the prevalence of machine translation devices, their performance has been assessed from multiple points, particularly focusing on linguistic features. However, few studies have probed context-awareness capabilities of both humans and machines to determine whether machines can fully or partially assist or replace human interpreters. To address the gap, our comparative study employed a quantitative quasi-experimental research design to investigate the linguistic differences arising from the adaptive expertise of human interpreters versus machine devices in simultaneous interpreting. The data collection involved outputs from 3 human interpreters, as well as Google Speech Translation (GST) and iFlytek.
